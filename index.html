        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>UX Designer and self-motivated learner on a constant search to absorb new information and create new ideas. Strong design skills developed from an experienced painter who holds a bachelor’s degree in Studio Art from Santa Clara University. Previous service and sales work experience have helped establish strong skills in understanding a company’s brand, and how it applies to the customer’s experience. I understand each customer as an individual, and learn to quickly customize interactive experiences for each customer’s individual needs. Classes in human factors and cognitive psychology as well as HTML and CSS have helped bridge the gap between user and developer. Thrives under high pressure situations and welcomes challenges.
